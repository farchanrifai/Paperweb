I'm a young and enthusiastic professional who has been responsible for providing accounting and finance services to companies from various industries. Experienced with Jurnal and Axapta, also a solid knowledge and experience with Xero. I have a strong interest in learning new things and gaining new experiences. While I enjoy working independently, I thrive when working in a team. Iâ€™m interested in accounting and taxation. I am also fascinated with graphic design and how consumer technology evolves. I spend my spare time on sports, learning design and programming, and hanging out with friends and family.
